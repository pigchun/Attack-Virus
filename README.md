# 🦠 Attack The Virus - Educational Shooter Game

**An interactive Unity game designed to teach students about human anatomy and virus behavior through engaging shooter mechanics.**

## 🎮 Overview

**Attack The Virus** is an educational 2D shooter game developed using **Unity** and **C#** as part of a university project at the **University of Illinois Chicago**. The game combines action gameplay with informative content, allowing players to learn about different parts of the human body and types of viruses in a fun, interactive environment.

> 🧠 Objective: Help players learn human anatomy and virus characteristics by navigating through bodily systems and eliminating viruses.

## 🧪 Key Features

- 🧬 **Educational Content**: Levels themed around organs (e.g., lungs, intestines) with virus types reflecting real-world behavior.
- 🤖 **State-Based AI**: Enemies exhibit behaviors like patrolling, chasing, and retreating using a modular state machine system.
- 🛠️ **Object-Oriented Design**: Inheritance used to reduce code duplication across multiple enemy types.
- 🎯 **Level Design**: Custom-built maps designed to simulate human body environments with layered tiles and obstacles.
- 📈 **Player Engagement**: Tested and iterated on enemy behavior to improve retention and interactivity.
